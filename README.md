# jeanine-TeaCozyProject.github.io

After adding the html, CSS and images, I modified the end result.
I reduced the space bewteen some of the text of the <h> tags by using br tags. I changes the background-color of the flex items (children) from black to sienna because this is a webpage selling tea.  I think the sienna color looks more like tea and has an organic sensibility that would appeal to the 'client'.
And I think it creates a better User experience as the Tea Cozy 'locations' stand out and are more readable.
